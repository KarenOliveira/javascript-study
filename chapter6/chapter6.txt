DOM -> Document Object Model

You can user Browser to get selector
Node List can use brackets and foreache
HTMLCollection can't be foreache but it can be treated like an array item[x]

Node List != HTMLCollection
Classlist -> Can see classes of a queryselector result

-> Inner text  for visible text
-> Content Text - > all Text

(html).toggle = on/off
